1. We are using 4 DC 3-6V Gearbox motors, 1 L298N Motor Driver Controller Board, 14in of PVC piping, an Arduino Uno for testing purposes. We will
use an ESP8266 for the final car and we are also using a distance sensor. We will be also using the Blynk app on a phone for driving and display. 
We are also using a 5V battery pack to power the car.
3. We still need to make motor mounts for our motors, walls for the car and a top cover for the car.
