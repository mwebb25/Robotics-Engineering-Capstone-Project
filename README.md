# Robotics-Engineering-Capstone-Project

Overview

Radio-Controlled cars or RC cars are miniature models of cars or trucks(figure 4). They can be controlled from distances using transmitters or remotes. Many kids have them as toys. They come in all shapes and sizes. There are also people who race RC cars. They have modified these cars to have an actual engine in them. They have designed these cars to be fast and aerodynamic. They can do fast wheel changes on these cars during the races.
In our project we will design a RC car to be very fast and aerodynamic. We will have a controller for a human to drive it around. It will have two arduinos connected to each other. One will be connected to the controller, the other will be in the car controlling it. We will have two motors controlling the back wheels to move forward. Servos in the front of the car will steer it.
We will design our car to be fast and lightweight. We will power it with a 5 volt battery pack and only use necessary components to make it as light as possible. Our arduinos will connect using radio waves. We can test this around the school on different surfaces.
