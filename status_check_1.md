1. We have found all of the electrical parts that we need for our final project. We have also wired our rear motors to the LN298N motor driver.
2. We have not ordered any parts yet. We do not believe that we will need to order any parts for this project. 
3. We have started a design but it is not yet finished. Our goal is to have it finished and printing by the end of the week. 
4. We believe that we will be able to complete the final design by May 13th. We have all the electric and mechanical parts that we need for this project.
We need to finalizes our design and print out the frame for our RC car. 
Output Display=Phone Screen and maybe led lights
Manual User Input=Buttons Programed on phone and on and off switch
Automatic Sensor=Distance sensor that stop car if it moves to close to objects
Actuators, Mechanisms, and Hardware=We have 2 dc motors to power the car and one servo to control the steering
Logic, Processing and Control=We will use WIFI to connect a phone to an ESP32 controller to control the car.
5. The steering system we think will be our biggest challenge. It will be hard to design and it will require lots of testing. The next challenge we think
will be difficult is the body of the car because it will be difficult to design and build using good materials. The last challenge we will have is
creating the app to control the robot because it will be time consuming and we will have to learn how to do that.
